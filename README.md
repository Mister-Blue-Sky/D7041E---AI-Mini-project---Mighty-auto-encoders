# D7041E - AI Miniproject - Mighty auto-encoders

## Main information

The "D7041E - Applied Artificial Intelligence" course of 2022 (LTU), led by Professor Evgeny Osipov, served as the backdrop for this project.

Group 5, consisting of Mario Ibarrola Aycart, Anthony Pages, and Louis Fr√©neau, set out to explore the capabilities of auto-encoders and showcase the concept of latent space. By utilizing various auto-encoder models, we were able to compress, denoise, and transfer the style of images. Our aim was to demonstrate the power and versatility of this type of neural network to our peers.

## How to get our results ?

To run the code, simply open the codebook and execute everything. Please note that the entire process may take over an hour to complete on a CPU (such as on Google Collab), due to the learning phases. If you choose to run the code on a GPU using Visual Studio Code, the process may only take a few minutes, but you will need a compatible and powerful GPU.

## I don't have time...

No problem, the PDF is here for you. It is basically an export of the codebook after every cells were executed.
